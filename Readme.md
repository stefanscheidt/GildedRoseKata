This Kata is the Java-port from Emilie Bache's [Github Repository](https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata).
This Kata was originally created by Terry Hughes (http://twitter.com/#!/TerryHughes). It is already on GitHub [here](https://github.com/NotMyself/GildedRose). See also Bobby Johnson's [description](http://iamnotmyself.com/2011/02/13/refactor-this-the-gilded-rose-kata/) of the kata.

The tests are taken from this [Gist](https://gist.github.com/xpmatteo/5243745.js). I added a gradle build file.

To start type
    ./gradlew
and to build an IntelliJ Idea Project type
    ./gradlew idea
