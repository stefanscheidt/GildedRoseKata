This Repo is based on [this](https://github.com/inevs/GildedRoseKata) from Sven GÃ¼nther.

This Kata is the Java-port from Emilie Bache's [Github Repository](https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata).

This Kata was originally created by Terry Hughes (http://twitter.com/#!/TerryHughes).
It is already on GitHub [here](https://github.com/NotMyself/GildedRose).
See also Bobby Johnson's [description](http://iamnotmyself.com/2011/02/13/refactor-this-the-gilded-rose-kata/) of the kata.

The tests are taken from this [Gist](https://gist.github.com/xpmatteo/5243745.js).
